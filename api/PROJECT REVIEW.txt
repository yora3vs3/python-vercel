PROJECT REVIEW

In this chapter  I have:
•	 Examined my code and determined if I need to refactor before implementing new features.
•	 Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen with appropriate 
spacing around it.
•	 Use the spacing around the first alien and the overall screen size to 
determine how many aliens can fit on the screen. We’ll write a loop to 
create aliens to fill the upper portion of the screen.
•	 Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot 
down, an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the ground. If the 
whole fleet is shot down, we’ll create a new fleet. If an alien hits the 
ship or the ground, we’ll destroy the ship and create a new fleet.
•	 Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when 
the player has used up the allotment of ships.
